# todolcu-ts
basic todo chat bot that connects to the LCU \
it reuses code from my previous project [LibLCU.ts](https://github.com/lotuspar/LibLCU.ts) (definitely due for a rewrite at this point)

this is a bad mishmash of previous projects; it was done in an hour and shouldn't be used - if you actually want to work with the LCU check out LibLCU above

## instructions
```
npm install
npm run test
```

## chat commands
```
help
list
add
remove
removelast
```
